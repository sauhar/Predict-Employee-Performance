    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <p>Companies need insights into employee performance based on KPI metrics like working hours, sales, and project completion rates. The objective is to develop a predictive model that accurately assesses employee performance, enabling data-driven decisions for management.</p>

  <h2>Libraries Required:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>pandas</strong> – Data handling</li>
        <li><strong>sklearn</strong> – Machine learning</li>
        <li><strong>matplotlib</strong> – Data visualization</li>
        <li><strong>seaborn</strong> – Statistical graphics</li>
        
</ul>
<h2>Algorithm Used:</h2>    
<li>The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is utilized for predicting employee performance. KNN is a simple, non-parametric algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class among their nearest neighbors.</li>

<h2>Usage</h2>
 
1. Prepare the dataset:
 <ul><li>Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory.</li></ul>
 
 
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
 <ul><li>Open and execute the Predict Employee Performance.ipynb notebook to preprocess the data, train the KNN model, and visualize the results.</li></ul>
